//Connect-four-project-1:
You read it correctly, you'll be playing Connect Four!
This is a tow player game that will ask for the name of each player and keep track of turns
player 1 is orange, player 2 is blue
the first to connect four is the winner! Have fun and play away!//

//Technologies used// Css, html, javascript//

//planned future enhancements: Will be updating some javascript functions and adding animations to give the game the aesthetic of 'Dragonball Z'! images have been collected to use for styling, just need to properly format to have them fit within the game structure.//
